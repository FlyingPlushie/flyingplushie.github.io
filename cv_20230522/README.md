# The Old CV Page

This is actually my entire old website that I used when searching for a job in 2023.

I wanted to save it for just in case. And to have something to remind me where I've come from.

The site's template is [Hyperspace](https://html5up.net/hyperspace) by [HTML5 UP](https://www.html5up.net) and [@ajlkn](https://aj.lkn.io/).
