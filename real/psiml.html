                PSIML6 - Petnica Summer Institute of Machine Learning, the 6<sup>th</sup>. It started as a call to students that I stumbled upon shortly after finishing Professor Ng's <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Course</a> back in 2020. After passing the competitive stage that pushed me harder than I could've anticipated, I got accepted into summer school. Before the lectures I may have had some illusions of knowing something, a bit of an ego-trip. But, when the lectures started I was quickly humbled and reminded how vast was the universe I tried to grasp. Our lecturers, people from the Faculty of Mathematics, School of Electrical Engineering, Microsoft Development Center in Serbia and from the Industry were exquisite &ndash; the experience was a privilege. The only downside was the event's online format &ndash; epidemic made the real trip impossible.

                I learned so much in so little time, it was phenomenal. I selected gesture recognition as my project, thinking it would prove useful later, during my PhD studies. The results are <a href="https://github.com/FlyingPlushie/GestureRecognitionPSIML6" target="_blank">in this GitHub repo.</a> We used <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch.</a> It's nothing spectacular, I finished late, but it works and it taught me a ton &ndash; which was the point. 
              </p>

                Experiences from PSIML6 shaped some of my PhD work. Shortly after the seminar I got my hands on the RGB-D camera and started tinkering with a real-time transfer of movements from a human subject to an industrial robot. That is still a work in progress.
