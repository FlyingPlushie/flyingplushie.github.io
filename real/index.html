							<h2>Fuzzy Path of Mine</h2>
							<p>
								I've been programming on and off since my third year of high-school. Started with Pascal and the thrill that came from seeing the computer do exactly as I tell it to, whether right or wrong. Continued with MATLAB while studying mechanical engineering. Somehow I got tangled up with Linux, CLI and vim, then distro-hopped until Ubuntu settled with me. Picked up touch-typing along the way &ndash; my current speed is around 100 WPM. Learned some C for my Master's Thesis that focused on the variants of linear and circular interpolations for real-time control of a plasma cutter via microcontroller.
							</p>
              <p>
								During my PhD studies, some projects were overwhelming, shoved me neck deep. But, I persevered &ndash; it was too much fun to quit. It started along the lines of "You know some C? Great, now you'll learn C++ and use it together with OpenGL." Afterwards, I just kept pushing. Learned Python on a hunch, seemed cool enough. Indeed, it supercharged my abilities and my selftaught learning pace, since I was freed from the rigor of the C++ compiler. Through several Python projects, I've learned OOP, Git and a few good programming practices after getting clogged down in my own spaghetti code, tangled with a total lack of version control. Then I got back into C++ and learned it properly, with constness, less segfaults and redness from the compiler.
							</p>
              <p>
								Currently, I'm sharpening my skills at <a href="https://leetcode.com/FlyingPlushie/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, getting better by the day. Also, I took up learning Java since <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Sedgewick's algorithms book</a> is written in it, making it easier to follow through.

									<h3>Programming Language Omnivore</h3>
									<p>
										C/C++ and Python base. Java is my most recent, but growing. Played with Lisp/Scheme through <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html" target="_blank">beautiful SICP</a>. A touch of C# for <a href="vids/when_bfg_kicks_in.mp4" target="_blank muted">Unity games</a>. A smidgen of JavaScript, CSS & HTML because bland presentations lose your audience. And LaTeX for serious texts.

									<h3>Jack of All Trades</h3>
									<p>
										"Read without mercy" my professor said and I take it quite seriously &ndash; still mind rots. New language? Great. New tech? Lemme see. Better framework? I'm in. Smarter way to do something? Yes. My craft is paramount to me and the only way to hone it is through surpassing my current limits.

									<h3>Solution Must Serve Well</h3>
									<p>
										I always strived to create things that people loved using, it's one of the aspects that makes this game so much fun &ndash; the human side &ndash; ghost in the machine. I admire and aspire to the good ones.

									<h3>Reliable Team Player</h3>
									<p>
										I play fair, by the rules and carry myself with my team, appreciating the people around me, even when the going gets tough. It's not the end of the world, just an obstacle, so we'll find a way through. Or around.
