    <h1>Page Under Severe Reconstruction</h1>
    <p>
        Since I've landed my long-sought tech job, the old CV page is <a href="./cv_20230522/index.html">right here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I'm redesigning this place to host my short stories and maybe some of my drawings. Stories come first and will be in Serbian and English. Yes, I could've gotten some plug-and-play theme with Jekyll or something similar, but where's the fun in that? I'll learn some web development along the way. Pure HTML will do until I make the page visually appealing.

        See you soon!<br>
