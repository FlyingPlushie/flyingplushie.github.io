                A client asked me to create a system that can connect to a server, get a list of paying users with allocated luggage lockers and grant access to allotted lockers when proper password gets entered at the local terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began from scratch, focusing on software, but along the way, due to my subpar negotiation skills at the time, I got dragged into hardware design as well, unnaturally prolonging the duration of the project. The task was too complex to solve on paper, so I learned the <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank">KiCad EDA</a> to handle design complexity and perfected my soldering skills while fabricating the modules.
              </p>
              <p>
                Raspberry Pi 3 was at the heart of the system, everything else custom tailored to suit the client's needs. I developed several hardware boards to achieve complete functionality &ndash; standard 12V locking/unlocking, extension interfaces for varying number of lockers, separate power supply module, all the while taking into account limited technical prowess of the personnel that will eventually operate the system. I managed to achieve local plug & play usability, with remote service access over Secure Shell (SSH).
              </p>
              <p>
                Language used was Python3. It stuck from the beginning &ndash; I wanted something easy to use, suitable for rapid prototyping and had C++ in mind if my clients prove to be strongly interested past the testing phase, since I was hired to create a working prototype, nothing more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the epidemic, the project got cancelled just before field-testing. Nevertheless, it was a great experience that taught me valuable lessons in dealing with clients, their vague specifications and growing expectations.
